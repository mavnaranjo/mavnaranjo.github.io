        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>I'm <a href="https://github.com/mavnaranjo">@mavnaranjo</a> and I'm here just playing a bit, don't judge me!</p>
        <p>If you also wanna play, here are some (well, one...) games (well, experiments...) I'm doing that you can try:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://mavnaranjo.github.io/particles">Particles</a>: NOT similar at all to agar.io</li>
        </ul>
        <p>PD: I won't care about sh!tty browsers AT ALL. This is MY playground, so here I can ignore the ugly details!</p>
